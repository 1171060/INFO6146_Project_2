# Problem Statement
Design, implement and evaluate an end-to-end unsupervised learning model using Keras and TensorFlow. The goal of the project is to develop a system that can identify patterns of anomalies in a given dataset and provide actionable recommendations based on the detected anomalies. 

# Dataset Description
TensorFlow Datasets provides a variety of datasets that you can use for anomaly detection tasks. Use the tfds.list_builders() function to see a list of available datasets, and search for Anomaly Detection Datasets using “search_results = tfds.list_builders(search_text='anomaly')”. Once you identify a dataset suitable for your anomaly detection task, you can load it using the tfds.load() function

Group 3 has selected a cred card fraud detection dataset from [https://www.kaggle.com/](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/mlg-ulb/creditcardfraud)

# Tasks to be Completed
**Marks: 50**

**1. Data Preprocessing and Exploration (4 marks)**
*	Load the chosen dataset and perform initial data exploration to understand its structure and characteristics.
*	Preprocess the data, handling missing values, scaling, and encoding categorical features if necessary.
*	Split the dataset into a training set and a test set.

**2. Unsupervised Learning Model Development (6 marks)**
*	Implement an autoencoder architecture using Keras to learn the normal patterns within the data.
*	Train the autoencoder on the training data with the objective of minimizing reconstruction error.
*	Use the trained autoencoder to reconstruct the data and calculate the reconstruction error for each instance.

**3.	Anomaly Detection (6 marks)**
*	Define a threshold for the reconstruction error above which instances are considered anomalous.
*	Identify instances in the test set that have a reconstruction error exceeding the threshold.
*	Flag these instances as anomalies.

**4. Actionable Recommendations (4 marks)**
*	For each detected anomaly, analyze the features that contributed the most to the anomaly.
*	Based on the specific features and context, provide actionable recommendations or suggestions for further investigation.
*	These recommendations could involve suggesting immediate actions or flagging the anomalies for further analysis by domain experts.

**5. Evaluation and Visualization (6 marks)**
*	Evaluate the performance of the anomaly detection model using metrics such as precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC curve.
*	Visualize the detected anomalies along with the actionable recommendations in a meaningful way.
*	Use visualizations and summary statistics to convey insights gained from the analysis.

**6. Model Refinement and Optimization (4 marks)**
*	Experiment with different autoencoder architectures, hyperparameters, and reconstruction error thresholds to fine-tune the model's performance.
*	Apply techniques such as learning rate scheduling, regularization, and dropout to improve the model's generalization and robustness.

**7. Documentation (10 marks) and 15 mins Presentation (10 marks)**
* Document the entire project, including the dataset description, preprocessing steps, model architecture, hyperparameter settings, and evaluation results.
* Create a presentation summarizing the project's objectives, methods, findings, and recommendations.
